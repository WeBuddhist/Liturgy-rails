"""Build 5-REVIEW/ — a reader-facing split of the corpus into what is finished
and what is not, so a reviewer can open a text and see every language at once.

Nothing here is canonical. Every file is a verbatim copy of the note it came
from; the canonical copies stay in 0-INBOX, 1-SOURCES/Text and
3-TRANSFORMATIONS/Translations. Re-run this after any upload or repair:

    python3 4-SYSTEM/scripts/build_review_bundle.py

"Done" means the upload ledger has the Tibetan edition plus all six
translations, each one carrying `aligned: true`. Anything short of that is not
done, and the reason is spelled out in the not-done folder.
